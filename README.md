<h2>Java Learning Based System Project </h2>
The main aim of the Java Learning Based System project is to provide 
 light software system which will improve the
 education system by changing manual to automating the tasks.
  It will provide a student-friendly environment to students.
   By using this Education Based System students can do most of 
   the academic task through this software. The education based
    system will reduce the paperwork and hence time consumption 
    required to complete the various tasks. As in the present 
    time, all the academic process is done by the manpower 
    which requires time and also the chance of error is more.
